# monombre
Monombre translates to "My Shadow"  in French. 
This project is meant to build a scalable personal assistant, preferably with some intelligence (AI/ML).
This will be a hybrid between a journaling / notes application.
It can be used for:
1. Capturing moments and memories that are personal but NOT meant for social media
2. Capturing something special - a location, a snack that you like, a restaurant that's awesome, a person you met (anything that's special)
3. Keeping them private yet on rare occasions, share it with the close ones. JUST specific items (using a unique QR Code)
4. Look up easily when needed (Need ML here. Also can use tags to help out)
5. Message the content to Monombre just like you would do to a "Buddy"
6. Occasionally drop jokes, facts etc.
7. More to come! :D
